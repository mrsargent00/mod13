## Description

This application was created as a homework assignment for the MSU Coding Bootcamp. The challenge required us to refactor existing code to create a back-end for an e-commerce site. 

Unfortently, with the issues that still persist with mysql, the current code does not wish to work. I have a password for the root user within the code (not for my actual mysql). I cannot get the code to work, and keep running into many errors along the way of figuring out mysql. 

Because I was unable to get my code to work, it would not show up in insomnia either.
